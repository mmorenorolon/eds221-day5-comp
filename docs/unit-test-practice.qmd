## Testing functions with {testthat}

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(devtools)
library(remotes)
```

Weâ€™re writing a function to find the mean value of each column, then return the lowest and highest mean calculated (in that order). We would expect:

- The outcome to be a numeric vector of length 2
- The first value in the vector is smaller than the second value in that vector


```{r}
mean_range <- function(df) {
  #returns the mean value of each column
  col_means <- apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  #minimum and maximum values
  col_mean_max <- max(col_means)
  col_mean_min <- min(col_means)
  
  #return minimum and maximum values in a vector
  return(c(col_mean_min, col_mean_max))
}

mean_range(mtcars)
```

```{r}
#Test that the output is of length 2
expect_length(mean_range(df = mtcars), 2)

#Test that the first value < the second value
expect_true(mean_range(mtcars)[1] < mean_range(mtcars)[2])
```

## Practice sourcing functions

```{r}
# source our food cart functions
source(here::here("src", "food_cart_functions.R"))

#Test (run) the function

name_cart("strawberry", "marmot")
```
